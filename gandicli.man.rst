The ``-i TEXT`` option (or ``--identity TEXT``) refers to a local ssh key, as used in the ssh command. The ``-l TEXT``, ``--login TEXT`` or ``user@host`` form specifies remote username in the same way. Using ``--wipe-key``, previous entry for that host is discarded from the known_hosts file first. Using ``--wait`` parameter, the command will wait for sshd to spin up on virtual machine before trying to open a ssh connection. You can add arguments (be sure to prefix options with the POSIX argument parsing ``--`` separator) and commands to ssh, as used in the ssh command.
